            >Gabi&apos;s shop is an ecommerce web application I developed during
            my early days in backend development. Built on top of many
            technologies, I got to improve my frontend skill and learnt a
            lot from this project. I worked with APIs without knowing what
            they really mean at that stage but looking back, I can see a lot
            of places I can improve the project with the skills I have
            gained over time and building more complex logic. Gabi&apos;s shop
            also features payment integration and is my first fullstack
            project.

            players. This was built when I was starting out with frontend
            technologies. It was really fun to build and took my a lesser
            time to build since I had done the same project with python Kivy
            framework. I took the project to the next level by adding a
            <q>Play with computer</q> feature. It&apos;s not an AI but it was a
            fun project, separating code logic ans writing DRY codes.

            as I got to build stuffs and develop complex algorithms from the
            ground up. Got daily feedbacks and reviews from collegue and
            employer. This experience helped me to build my confidence and
            get out of the "Impostor Syndrome" phase faced by software
            developers.

            the time of registration won&apos;t be allowed to access the voting
            page. Relevant errors where displayed to tell the users just

            I even had to build a custom template tag in django and it was
            cool.
